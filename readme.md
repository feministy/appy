# appy

A very basic knitting pattern generator for my design business. You drop in the information for the pattern, save it, and automagically get a PDF for your downloading pleasure.

PDFs are generated using Prawn. Built with Twitter Bootstrap because lazy.

#### to do

- format pdf (this is always a todo)
- figure out sizing (tables? inline? multiple PDFs?)
- moar tests (always moar tests)
- legend upload
- add charts, legends to PDF
- validations on models (whoops...)
- math functions for sizing patterns?
- add form field for "free" to patterns
- figure out how to work flat v. round because some patterns have both
- API for pattern data
- would be super awesome if i could pull ravelry sales info here...
