[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/feministy/appy.png)](https://travis-ci.org/feministy/appy)


A very basic knitting pattern generator for my design business. You drop in the information for the pattern, save it, and automagically get a PDF for your downloading pleasure.

PDFs are generated using Prawn. Built with Twitter Bootstrap because lazy.

The current version of this project only creates PDFs. Future versions will be more workbench-style and will have tech editing, test knitting, and drafting capabilities.

#### test todos

- complete controller specs
- complete request specs

#### paperclip

- set ENV
- set ENV for heroku
- test production

#### todo

- format pdf (this is always a todo)
- validations on models (whoops...)
- math functions for sizing patterns?
- figure out how to work flat v. round because some patterns have both

#### workbench todo

- tech editing PDF annotation
- pattern drafting/note taking (???)
- *comments feature* admin users should be able to reply to comments (???)
- make sure that user permissions are consistent across app
