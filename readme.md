# appy

A very basic knitting pattern generator for my design business. You drop in the information for the pattern, save it, and automagically get a PDF for your downloading pleasure.

PDFs are generated using Prawn. Built with Twitter Bootstrap because lazy.

#### to do

- format pdf (this is always a todo)
- figure out sizing (tables? inline? multiple PDFs?)
- moar tests (always moar tests)
- charts and legends (charts WIP, legends done)
- validations on models (whoops...)
- math functions for sizing patterns?
