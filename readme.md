# appy

A very basic knitting pattern generator for my design business. You drop in the information for the pattern, save it, and print the display page as a PDF without the headers and footers.

PDFs are generated using Prawn.

#### to do

- format pdf (maybe make it prettier? I kinda like it so far)
- figure out sizing (tables? inline? multiple PDFs?)
- moar tests (always moar tests)
- charts and legends (charts WIP, legends done)
