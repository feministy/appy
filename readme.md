[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/feministy/appy.png)](https://travis-ci.org/feministy/appy)

A very basic knitting pattern generator for my design business. You drop in the information for the pattern, save it, and automagically get a PDF for your downloading pleasure.

PDFs are generated using Prawn. Built with Twitter Bootstrap because lazy.

The current version of this project:

- has roles for admins, testers, and editors
- creates PDFs for patterns from form input
- allows testers to comment on patterns
- allows admins to mark testers' comments as resolved

Future versions will have:

- annotation for editors
- in-line comments for admins
